  New <a href=https://gillian-guide.github.io/essential-modding/fusionfix/>FusionFix</a> version is available <b>now</b> with a lot of changes to the game!<br>
  To celebrate the occasion, I have completely overhauled the website. Enjoy!<br><br>
  I've also been suffering with my PC lately, so I'd appreciate <a href=https://gillian-guide.github.io/resources/credits>some monetary help a lot</a> (make sure to donate to the mod devs too!)
