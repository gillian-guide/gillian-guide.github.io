# Introduction

Welcome to Gillian's Grand Theft Auto IV Modding Guide.

This is a centralized, all-in-one guide. It includes steps for [optimizing](optimization.md), [tweaking](additional-setup.md), [fixing, improving](essential-modding/index.md) the game, [experiencing multiplayer](multiplayer.md) and [more](extras/index.md)!

Following the steps in this guide may violate Rockstar's End User License Agreement (EULA), and if you contact their support, they may refuse to help you because of the EULA violation. I am not the author of any of the following modifications, so any bugs/crashes/errors should be reported to the developers themselves. 

## Prerequisites
!!! warning ""
    - In order for this guide to be useful to you, please make sure that the following requirements are met:
        * You **must** own the game on [:material-steam:Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/12210/) or the [Rockstar Games Launcher](https://store.rockstargames.com/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-iv). Pirated versions are not supported. Retail versions with 1.0.8.0 are not supported, but should work as long as you get rid of the DRM.
        * Your PC must at least meet the [minimum requirements of the game](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#System_requirements "Requirements on PCGW - copied from Steam"). For a pleasant experience, however, it should also meet [DXVK's requirements](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support "DXVK's GitHub Wiki")(ignore Linux requirements such as Wine if you're running Windows; older GPUs may meet the 1.10.3 requirements instead).
        * The game should not be located in :material-folder:`C:\Program Files` or :material-folder:`C:\Program Files (x86)` to avoid permission issues. ==This is irrelevant for :material-steam:Steam users.==
        * Make sure you have enough free space on your drive (the base game takes about 22GB, a backup will take just as much, plus count in all the modding you'd do - at least 4GB).
        * You need to have an archivator installed. I recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "Official 7-Zip website").
        * Make sure you have the game's prerequisites installed(they're already taken care of by :material-steam:Steam and the Rockstar Games Launcher) - [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 **x86**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 "Microsoft's official redistributables") and [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109 "Microsoft's official redistributables").

## Gameplay Demo
Your game will look and play roughly like this after finishing the modding (the [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) has been used for this video).

## Sections
If you have no need for the in-depth tutorials, you can simply install the [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) and you are ready to go.

Otherwise, start with [optimization](optimization.md).
