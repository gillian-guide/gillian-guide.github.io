description: Add extra features to your GTA IV experience - for whatever reason you may need them!

# Trainers
Trainers are essentially modmenus that add a lot of fun and useful options. You may want one for [multiplayer](../multiplayer.md), but make sure your server allows them.
## ZMenuIV
!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This trainer is not compatible with the Complete Edition. [Downgrade](../downgrading.md) if using the Complete Edition.
The most powerful and full-fledged trainer for GTA IV. Also includes a Chaos mod for streamers and fun. And... Goldsrc physics...? Bhopping is fun, I guess.

    Edit the `[Keybinds]` and `[CustomHotkeys]` sections in :material-file-cog:`ZMenuIV.ini` to change or add keybinds.
    ??? tip "Setting up Numpad-less keybinds"
        Not everyone has a Numpad, I get it, 80% (and less) keyboards are cool and comfortable. Open :material-file-cog:`ZMenuIV.ini` and locate these lines:

        ```{ .ini }
        [Keybinds]
        AirbreakUp=87
        AirbreakDn=83
        AirbreakForward=104
        AirbreakBack=98
        AirbreakLeft=100
        AirbreakRight=102
        MenuUp=104
        MenuDn=98
        MenuLeft=100
        MenuRight=102
        MenuEnter=101
        MenuBack=96
        ```

        and change them to:

        ```{ .ini }
        [Keybinds]
        AirbreakUp=69
        AirbreakDn=81
        AirbreakForward=87
        AirbreakBack=83
        AirbreakLeft=65
        AirbreakRight=68
        MenuUp=38
        MenuDn=40
        MenuLeft=37
        MenuRight=39
        MenuEnter=13
        MenuBack=8
        ```

        - Which will be:
            * Arrow keys for navigation. ++enter++ to accept, ++backspace++ to go back.
            * ++w++++a++++s++++d++ for horizontal airbreak control, ++q++ and ++e++ for vertical.

## Liberty's Legacy
!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This trainer is not as powerful as ZMenuIV, but still offers a lot of useful features, especially if you're playing with the Complete Edition.
???+ info "Installation"
    * Get the latest [Ultimate ASI Loader](../../mod-dependencies/#ultimate-asi-loader) and [ScriptHook](../../mod-dependencies/#scripthook).
    * Go to the [GTAForums page](https://gtaforums.com/topic/973091-gta-iv-12043-libertys-legacy-trainer/).
    * Download the latest version.
    * Extract :material-zip-box:`Liberty's Legacy Trainer xxx.zip` into the game folder.
???+ tip "Usage"
    - The default controls are: 
        * ++f11++ or RB+X/R1+Square to toggle menu.
        * Arrow keys or D-Pad for navigation. ++enter++ or A/X to accept, ++backspace++ or B/Circle to go back.
