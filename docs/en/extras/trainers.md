# Trainers

Trainers are essentially modmenus that add a lot of fun and useful options. They're also a better alternative to the very limited amount of [cheatcodes](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Cheats_in_GTA_IV) the game offers. You may want one for [multiplayer](multiplayer.md), but make sure your client/server allows them first.

!!! warning ""
    Both trainers require [Ultimate ASI Loader](../../resources/mod-dependencies.md/#ultimate-asi-loader).

    Also please pick one - don't install both at once.

## [ZMenuIV](https://zolika1351.pages.dev/mods/ivmenu)

!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This trainer is not compatible with the Complete Edition.
The most powerful and full-fledged trainer for GTA IV. Also includes a Chaos mod with streamer support, and features as absurd as GoldSrc physics.

<h3>Installation</h3>

1. Go to [Zolika1351's Zone](https://zolika1351.pages.dev/mods/ivmenu).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and download the latest version.
3. Extract :material-zip-box:`ZMenuIV_vx.zip` into the game folder
    - Do not extract :material-folder: `asi loader if not using xliveless`, :material-folder: `for developers`, :material-folder: `old version (has VR support)`, :material-folder: `parachute support(all into game folder)`. Read the :material-file:`readme.txt` for details on these folders.

<h3>Usage</h3>

The default hotkeys are:

- ++f7++ to toggle menu.
- ++num8++, ++num2++, ++num4++, ++num6++ for navigation, ++num5++ to accept, ++num0++ to go back.
- ++right-control+num1++ to fix the car.
- ++right-control+num2++ to flip the car.
- ++bracket-right++ (hold) to speed the car up.
- ++f6++ for Airbreak (noclip).
- ++0++ for Always God Mode.
- ++bracket-left++ for Never Wanted.
- ++semicolon++ for Unlimited Ammo.
- ++equal++ for Collision.
- ++minus++ for Resurrect.
- ++m++ for Ragdoll.

You can add your own custom keybinds that can combine multiple options together. To do so, enable `Custom Keybind Creator` in `Trainer Settings`, highlight the desired option and press ++left-control+enter++ to set the keybind up.

Edit the `[Keybinds]` section in :material-file-cog:`ZMenuIV.ini` to change existing keybinds.

??? tip "Setting up Numpad-less keybinds"
    Not everyone has a Numpad, I get it, 80% (and less) keyboards are cool and comfortable. Open :material-file-cog:`ZMenuIV.ini` and locate these lines:

    ```{ .ini }
    [Keybinds]
    AirbreakUp=87
    AirbreakDn=83
    AirbreakForward=104
    AirbreakBack=98
    AirbreakLeft=100
    AirbreakRight=102
    MenuUp=104
    MenuDn=98
    MenuLeft=100
    MenuRight=102
    MenuEnter=101
    MenuBack=96
    ```

    and change them to:

    ```{ .ini }
    [Keybinds]
    AirbreakUp=32
    AirbreakDn=160
    AirbreakForward=87
    AirbreakBack=83
    AirbreakLeft=65
    AirbreakRight=68
    MenuUp=73
    MenuDn=75
    MenuLeft=74
    MenuRight=76
    MenuEnter=13
    MenuBack=220
    ```

    Which will be:

    - ++i++++j++++k++++l++ for navigation. ++enter++ to accept, ++backslash++ to go back.
    - ++w++++a++++s++++d++ for horizontal airbreak control, ++space++ for going up and ++lshift++ for going down.
