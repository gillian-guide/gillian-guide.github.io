# Mods

To finish this guide off, I will give a list of more mods that couldn't find their place in other parts of the guide due to their niche status, potential incompatibilites, or something else. I won't list instructions on how to install them, as mods usually list their own instructions, so it becomes redundant.

!!! warning ""
    - Be sure to back up your files before making any changes.
    - Use a [modloader](modloading.md) to avoid file replacements when asked to do so.
    - I'm only listing these mods - I don't intend for people to actually install all of them together. Pick what to install yourself.

## Afterword

Thanks for using **my** guide for modding GTA IV!

I sincerely hope that I have helped you achieve the perfect state of the game. This guide takes some time to maintain, and it couldn't have been done without all the great mods, so please consider chipping in for some authors: [Credits](../../resources/credits.md).
