# Mods

To finish this guide off, I will give a list of more mods that couldn't find their place in other parts of the guide due to their niche status, potential incompatibilites, or something else. I won't list instructions on how to install them, as mods usually list their own instructions, so it becomes redundant.

!!! warning ""
    - Be sure to back up your files before making any changes.
    - Use a [modloader](modloading.md) to avoid file replacements.
    - I'm only listing these mods - I don't intend for people to actually install all of them together. Pick what to install yourself.
