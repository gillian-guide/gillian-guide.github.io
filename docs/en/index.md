## Overview

**Welcome to Gillian's Grand Theft Auto IV Modding Guide, a centralized and modular all-in-one modding guide.**

This guide aims to provide the best vanilla-faithful experience for GTA IV, but is not limited to that. It's meant to be accessible to everyone and to be able to help anyone who has their own specifics on how they want to experience the game - be it creating the best singleplayer experience, creating the best environment for manual modding, playing multiplayer, getting the best performance, or something else.

!!! note ""
    This guide aims to be as unbiased as possible, and tries to provide only relevant information for modding GTA IV. Any mods or information listed do not reflect my personal opinion of anyone, and I'd prefer this guide to be free of personal bias.

    However, one strict rule is enforced: **all modifications mentioned must preserve the original feel of the game.**

## Prerequisites

!!! warning ""
    In order for this guide to be useful to you, **please make sure the following prerequisites are met.**

    **^^If they are not, I will be reluctant to help you if something goes wrong - and one of the additional requirements is to read everything as is and don't skip anything.^^**

- **You must own the game on [:material-steam:Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/12210/) or the [Rockstar Games Launcher](https://store.rockstargames.com/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-iv). Pirated versions will not receive guaranteed support from me if any problems occur.** Other versions may work, but no guarantee is given, nor will I provide support if any problems occur.
- **Operating system:** Your PC **should be running Windows 10 or 11 or any up-to-date Linux distribution suited for gaming**. Older Windows versions may work, but I will not provide support for them. ARM64 systems have not been tested.
- **Hardware:** Your PC **must meet the [minimum requirements of the game](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#System_requirements "Game requirements on PCGW - copied from Steam")**. For the **best experience, it should also meet my personal recommended spec sheet below** which ensures pleasant gameplay with mods at Full HD resolution and 60Hz screen. Scale manually for your own needs:

    | Hardware     | Recommended         | Alternative                             |
    | :----------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
    | **OS**       | Windows 10/11       | Linux                                   |
    | **CPU**      | Intel Core i5-6600k | Ryzen 3 2200G                           |
    | **GPU**      | GTX 970/1050Ti      | RX580, Intel Arc A310                   |
    | **RAM**      | 8GB                 |                                         |
    | **Storage**  | 30GB (Ideally SSD)  | If manually modding, ~70 GB for backups |

- **Software:**
    - You need to have an archivator installed. I recommend **[NanaZip](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8g7tscl18r?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=us)** or **[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "Official 7-Zip website")**.
    - It is highly recommended to **[update your GPU drivers](optimization/#drivers)**.
    - Make sure you have the game's prerequisites installed - [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/ "VC++ Runtimes All-in-One") (extract and run :material-file-download:`install_all.bat`) and [Microsoft DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109 "Microsoft's official redistributables"). ==Usually, they are already installed if using :material-steam:Steam or the Rockstar Games Launcher.==
- **The game should not be located in :material-folder:`C:\Program Files` or :material-folder:`C:\Program Files (x86)` to avoid permission issues.** ==This is irrelevant for :material-steam:Steam users.==
