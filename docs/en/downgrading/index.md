## Overview

To make things easier later, you should decide what do you want to downgrade right now between radio, the game version, or both.

## Radio

Over 50 radio station tracks were removed from the game in April 2018 due to expired licenses. They were also replaced with tracks that feel unathentic in many ways.

!!! warning ""
    Consider downgrading the radio before the game, as doing it in reverse order is more annoying.

If you had decided to downgrade the radio, proceed here:

## Game versions

### Complete Edition (1.2.0.59)

This is the latest version of the game, which you normally receive when installing the game on :material-steam:Steam or :simple-rockstargames: Rockstar Games Launcher. ==This version should be preferred if you want the **best singleplayer campaign experience.**==

        :material-plus-box: It works out of the box. No modifications are required to launch the game.<br>
        :material-plus-box: Best support for modern mods made after 2020, such as FusionFix. This ensures getting the most fixes possible when modding.<br>

        :material-minus-box: Rockstar Games Launcher and it's DRM is required, which can be considered bloat for multiple reasons: the game launches for a minute longer and it does not provide anything but achievements to the game, to name two.<br>
        :material-minus-box: Compatibility with old mods is not guaranteed. While some mods work, there are some that do not. They are not critical to fixing the game, though.<br>

        :material-minus-box: Some songs were removed from the radio due to licensing. They can be restored with mods.

### Retail version (1.0.8.0)

This is the version of the game that existed before the Complete Edition. ==This version should only be preferred if you want to **play the multiplayer**, use  **specific mods** you have in mind that don't support CE or want to **play without DRM.**==

### Retail version (1.0.4.0)
