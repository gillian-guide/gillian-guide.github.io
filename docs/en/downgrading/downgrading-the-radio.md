<h2>Instructions</h2> <a id="instructions"></a>

1. Go to the [**Various GTA Downgraders** website](http://downgraders.rockstarvision.com/) and scroll to the bottom of the page.
2. Download the **Radio Restoration mod for GTAIV CE**.
3. Extract the :material-zip-box:`Radio Restoration Mod xx-xx-xx.rar` archive into any empty folder.
4. Run :material-file-download:`IVCERadioRestorer.exe` and follow the in-app instructions.
    - You can additionally install [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/gta4/mods/234/?tab=files&file_id=646) to partially restore the original TBoGT menu theme.

???+ question "What's the difference between only pre-cut Vladivostok and pre-cut plus post-cut?"
    Rockstar added new tracks to the Vladivostok radio station to replace the cut ones. "pre-cut plus post-cut" keeps the new tracks alongside the restored cut ones, while "only pre-cut songs" cuts the new ones out, only keeping the restored ones.
