<h2>Instructions</h2> <a id="instructions"></a>

1. Go to the latest [release page](https://github.com/Tomasak/GTA-Downgraders/releases/iv-latest).
2. Download the :material-zip-box:`Radio.Restoration.Mod.xx-xx-xxxx.zip`.
3. Extract the archive into into any empty folder.
4. Run :material-file-download:`IVCERadioRestorer.exe` and follow the in-app instructions.

???+ question "What's the difference between only pre-cut Vladivostok and pre-cut plus post-cut?"
    Rockstar added new tracks to the Vladivostok radio station to replace the cut ones. "pre-cut plus post-cut" keeps the new tracks alongside the restored cut ones, while "only pre-cut songs" cuts the new ones out, only keeping the restored ones.
