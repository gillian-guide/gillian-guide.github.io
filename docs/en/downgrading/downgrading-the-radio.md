# Downgrading the radio

!!! warning ""
    If you had downgraded the game earlier, this downgrader will not work.

## Instructions

1. Go to the [**Various GTA Downgraders** website](http://downgraders.rockstarvision.com/) and scroll to the bottom of the page.
2. Download the **Radio Restoration mod for GTAIV CE**.
3. Extract the :material-zip-box:`Radio Restoration Mod 31-12-23.rar` archive into any empty folder.
4. Run :material-file-download:`IVCERadioRestorer.exe` and follow the in-app instructions.

???+ question "What's the difference between only pre-cut Vladivostok and pre-cut plus post-cut?"
    Rockstar added new tracks to the Vladivostok radio station to replace the cut ones. pre-cut plus post-cut keeps the new tracks alongside the restored cut ones, while only pre-cut songs cuts the new ones out, only keeping the restored ones.
