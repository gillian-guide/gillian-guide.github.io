# Downgrading the radio

???+ note "Installation"
    - Go to the [Various GTA Downgraders website](http://downgraders.rockstarvision.com/) and scroll to the bottom of the page.
    - Download the Radio Restoration mod for GTAIV CE.
    - Extract the :material-zip-box:`GTAIVCERADIORESTOREINSTALLER.zip` into any empty folder.
    - Run :material-file-download:`IVCERadioRestorer.exe` and follow the in-app instructions. Pick to install [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md) if you didn't install it beforehand (install manually on older patches).
    ???+ question "What's the difference between only pre-cut Vladivostok and pre-+post-cut?"
        Rockstar added new tracks to Vladivostok to replace the cut ones. Pre-+post-cut keeps these alongside the restored cut ones, while only pre-cut songs cuts them out, only keeping the restored ones.
