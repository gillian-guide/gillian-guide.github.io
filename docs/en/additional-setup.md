# Additional Setup

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- If you're here after installing the archive or using the Setup Utility on Windows, **skip to optimal graphics settings**:

</div>

If you're here after anything else (including installing the archive on Linux), start with the **launch options.**

## Launch options

!!! tip "Setup Utility (**Windows only**)"
    The [Setup Utility](../optimization.md/#setup-utility-automatic-installation) can set up the launch options automatically for you.

### Manual instructions

=== "1.2.0.59"
    1. Find the location for the game properties:
        - **:material-steam: Steam**: Right click the game in your library, press `Properties...` and locate the `Launch options` field.
        - **:simple-rockstargames: Rockstar Games Launcher**: Open the game page in your library, open settings and locate the `Launcher arguments` field.
        - **Shortcut**: Right click on the game shortcut, click `Properties` and locate the `Target` field.
    2. Paste the following:

        ```text
        -norestrictions -nomemrestrict -managed
        ```

    3. If using **FusionFix**, enable `Windowed` and `Borderless Windowed` in `Settings` - `Game` in-game.
=== "1.0.8.0"
    1. In the game folder, create a :material-file-cog:`commandline.txt` file.
    2. Open the file.
    3. Insert the following lines to it:

        ```text
        -norestrictions
        -nomemrestrict
        -windowed
        -managed
        ```

    4. If using **FusionFix**, `-windowed` can be removed in favor of the mod's in-game toggle.
    5. If using **FusionFix** and/or **ZolikaPatch**, enable `Borderless Windowed` in `Settings` - `Game` in-game or `BorderlessWindowed` in :material-file-cog:`ZolikaPatch.ini` depending on which of the two you install.
        - **If you don't plan to install either of the mods, remove `-windowed`.**
        - If using both, only enable the option in **FusionFix**.

???+ warning "If using DXVK..."
    - Remove `-managed`.
    - Add `-availablevidmem 3072.0` to the list of options.
        - This option is **UNNECESSARY** if **FusionFix 4.0.0** or above is installed.
        - Replace the value with your VRAM value in MBs if you have less than 3 GB of VRAM. Don't make it higher, though.
        - If using a version older than 1.0.8.0, this value is broken. Experiment manually to get as close to 3072 MB as possible (the value may looks something like 60.0, 80.0 etc).
    - If the game doesn't allow you to use the correct resolution/refresh rate in the graphics settings, add `-width`, `-height` and `-refreshrate` with your monitor's native values.
        - If that still doesn't help, add `d3d9.forceAspectRatio = 16:9` to :material-file-cog:`dxvk.conf`. Change `16:9` with your *[exact](https://stevewadsworth.github.io/calculateAspectRatio/)* aspect ratio if you don't use a 16:9 monitor.
    - If using Windows, make sure you disabled `Enable Shader Pre-caching` in `Settings` - `Downloads` on :material-steam: Steam.

## Optimal graphics settings

!!! note ""
    Following settings are targetted for the [recommended spec sheet hardware](index.md/#prerequisites).

    If you came here from the archive, use the FusionFix tab.

=== "Vanilla"
    | Setting | Optimal setting | Description |
    | :-----: | :-------------: | :---------: |
    | Video Mode | Your native resolution (max option, usually) | This setting controls your monitor resolution or, if the `-windowed` launch option is set, the size of the game window. |
    | Aspect Ratio | Auto | This setting controls the aspect ratio of the screen relative to the resolution of your monitor. |
    | Texture Quality | High | This setting controls the resolution of all textures. |
    | Reflection Resolution | Very High | This setting controls the resolution of reflections (excluding water reflections). |
    | Water Quality | Medium | This setting controls the density and intensity of waves in the water, aswell as the resolution of water reflections.<br>***Medium* is recommended as it is less extreme, more realistic and most similar to the intended look on the consoles.** |
    | Shadow Quality | High | This setting controls the resolution and render distance of shadows.<br>**Medium** and **Low** rely too much on static shadows, making them look ugly.<br>***Very High* consumes too much performance for little gain and may appear broken at times.** |
    | Night Shadows | Medium | This setting controls how many local lights (e.g. car headlights) can cast shadows. Each quality level adds 4 additional shadow maps. This setting does not affect the resolution of dynamic shadows.<br>**Setting it above *Medium* is known to create artifacts.** |
    | Texture Filter Quality | Anisotropic 16x | This setting controls texture filtering. |
    | View Distance | Between 21 and 70 | This setting controls the main LOD render distance for things like buildings and vehicles. Also affects the render distance for props.<br>**Setting it above *21* causes pop-in, and above *70* is known to cause instability and artifacts, as well as a negative impact on framerate.** |
    | Detail Distance | Between 10 and 70 | This setting controls the secondary LOD render distance for props detail.<br>**Setting it above *10* causes pop-in, and above *70* is known to cause instability and artifacts.** |
    | Vehicle Density | Below 70 | This setting controls the number of cars on the road.<br>**Setting it too high can make driving too much of a hassle, especially with the unstable traffic AI, which can occasionally create random blocks even on straight roads and bridges.** |
    | Definition | On<br>Off if playing at 1280x720 | This setting controls depth of field and motion blur (**Off** is enabled, **On** is disabled).<br>**If playing above 1280x720, *Off* ends up blurring the image on PC and effects simply do not scale up with resolution - due to that, keep it *On* unless you play at that resolution.**<br>Can be quickly toggled by pressing ++p++ button in-game.</br> |
    | VSync | Off if using DXVK<br>On | This setting controls vertical synchronization.<br>**If using [DXVK](optimization.md) with configuration applied, keep the game's implementation *Off* in favor of DXVK's implementation. ==Also add `d3d9.maxFrameRate = 60` to :material-file:`dxvk.conf` or limit framerate with other methods you know to 60 or 30 to avoid [timing-related issues](https://github.com/GTAmodding/GTAIV-Issues-List/issues/112).==** AMD Fluid Motion Frames (if DXVK is used) or [Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) can be used to artificially increase the framerate. |
