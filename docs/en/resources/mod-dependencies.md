# Mod Dependencies

## [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader)

 UAL is used to load `.asi` mods (one of the most common types of GTA IV mods) into the game. It's multipurpose and can be used for many other games, but we will use it for GTA IV.

!!! info "Compatibility"
    Ultimate ASI Loader is compatible with all game versions.

<h3>Installation</h3>

1. Go to the latest [release page](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/latest).
2. Download :material-zip-box: `Ultimate-ASI-Loader.zip` (**not :material-zip-box:`Ultimate-ASI-Loader_x64.zip`**).
3. Extract the archive into the game folder.

!!! warning "If using Linux..."
    Add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b" %command%` to your Launch options:

    - **:material-steam: Steam**: Right click the game in your library, press `Properties...` and paste the line in the `Launch options` field.
    - **:simple-rockstargames: Rockstar Games Launcher**: Open the game page in your library, open settings and paste the line in the `Launcher arguments` field.
    - **Windows shortcut**: Right click on the game shortcut, click `Properties` and paste the line in `Target` field.

!!! tip "Getting rid of Games for Windows - LIVE (for retail patches)"
    This tool can be used to get rid of GFWL if you're not interested in official [GFWL multiplayer](../../multiplayer.md/#games-for-windows-live) and Xbox Live achievements. This will reduce the amount of hassle and setup you have to do.

    - Rename the :fontawesome-solid-gears:`dinput8.dll` to `xlive.dll`

!!! tip "Modloading"
    Ultimate ASI Loader can be used for modloading purposes. See [modloading](extras/modloading.md) for more details.

## Getting ScriptHookDotNet and IV-SDK .NET to work on Linux

By default, neither of those two will run on Linux. This can be fixed, however. These instructions will assume you are an experienced Linux user, so if you don't get something - Google it.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

1. Install [Protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks)
2. Open a terminal and run the following command to install .NET in the GTA IV prefix:

    ```text
    protontricks 12210 -q dotnet472
    ```
    - If you installed Protontricks through Flatpak, run this:
        ```text
        flatpak run com.github.Matoking.protontricks 12210 -q dotnet472
        ```
3. Wait until .NET installs (may take from 5 to 30 minutes).

If using Lutris (or any other form of managing GTA IV outside of Steam), use Winetricks instead.
