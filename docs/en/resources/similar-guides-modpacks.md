# Similar Guides & Modpacks

Do you want more guides & modpacks like this but for other games? I got you covered, as I also love modding! All of the following guides & modpacks have been personally used by me and I can vouch for their quality, as much as you can vouch for my guide!

## [Fallout: New Vegas (Viva New Vegas)](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/)

## [Tale of Two Wastelands (The Best of Times)](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/)

- This is a mod to port Fallout 3 content to Fallout: New Vegas and merge the best of two worlds.

## [Fallout 4 (The Midnight Ride)](https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/)

## [Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Vice City, III and the Stories games (Classic Edition)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967678943)

- If you're non-russian speaking, use Google Translate on the page and remove :material-file:`RUSSIFIER` from :material-folder:`modloader`.
- The modpack is modular, so just remove something if you don't like it.
- The same person has modpacks for GTA Vice City, III and the Stories games, they're on the bottom of the Steam Guide.

## [Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Carbon (Classic Edition & Rework)](https://discord.gg/Xy7KrNgymb)
