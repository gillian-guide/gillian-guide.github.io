# Essential Modding

In this category, you'll find mods that I think are essential to any GTA IV installation, along with instructions on how to install and configure them.

!!! warning ""
    Every mod onwards requires [Ultimate ASI Loader](../../resources/mod-dependencies.md/#ultimate-asi-loader).

## [FusionFix](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix)

This project aims to fix or address most **graphical and gameplay issues** and introduces new graphics options. ^^Highly recommended for any IV install.^^

## [ZolikaPatch](https://zolika1351.pages.dev/mods/ivpatch)

!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This mod is compatible with all downgraded versions, but not Complete Edition. Skip this mod if you do not intend to downgrade - the improvements are negligible if you do not play the [multiplayer](../extras/multiplayer.md).

This project aims to fix or address some **gameplay issues, aswell as improving core multiplayer experience.** ^^Highly recommended for a downgraded install.^^
