# Additional Fixes (List)

Following mods are fixes that I'd personally consider essential, as they don't have any downsides or incompatibilities to them.

!!! warning ""
    [FusionFix](../essential-modding/fusionfix.md) is required for most mods. **This page will assume you have it installed and will not remind you of it.**

!!! warning "For Linux users"
    When installing mods, be careful and take note when filenames have different casing (e.g. `weaponinfo.xml` and `weaponInfo.xml`). Make sure to merge them accordingly.

## `.img` limits

You may want to manually merge some `.img` mods together using [OpenIV](../../resources/openiv.md/#creating-archives) to avoid going over the limit.

You can see how far you are on the limits if you set `ExtraInfo` to `1` in FusionFix's :material-file-cog:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.ini` - it'll give the number on bottom of the screen in settings - **but only on 1.2.0.58**. If you are using an older version, you can only tell if you went over the limit by going into TBoGT and seeing whether traffic spawns (if it doesn't - you're over the limit and it's a sign to merge some mods).
