description: One of the must-have mods for your GTA IV install that fixes a lot of map and texture issues

# [Various Fixes](https://gtaforums.com/topic/975211-various-fixes/)

This project aims to fix or improve a large amount of map issues and textures. You can see the changelog on the [GTAForums page](https://gtaforums.com/topic/975211-various-fixes/).

<h2>Installation</h2>

1. Make sure you have installed [FusionFix](fusionfix.md).
2. Go to the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nLq3uiw1XFW5lrIwdSLuk2ZhpEWzdLw0).
3. Download the :material-zip-box:`Installation through Fusion Overloader` archive.
4. Extract the :material-folder: ==update== folder (not it's contents) into the game folder. Replace files if prompted.
5. You can also install some extras from the :material-zip-box:`Optional Content` archive. Use the :material-folder: ==Installation through Fusion Overloader== folder and do the same with the contents as step 4.

???+ question "Other installation methods"
    You can also go through with the manual or auto-installation, but it's frankly more unnecessary effort and harder to make to work with other mods than using this.
