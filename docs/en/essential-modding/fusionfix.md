!!! warning "Compatibility"
    This mod is only officially supported on the Complete Edition, but with taking several things in account, you can also use it with 1.0.8.0.

    Support for non-CE versions may be axed at any time and the developers don't provide any support for them.
This project aims to fix or address most **graphical and gameplay issues** and introduces new graphics options. You can read the changelog [here](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix/tree/master#coregameplay-changelog).

<h2>Installation</h2> <a id="installation"></a>

=== "1.2.0.59"
    1. Go to the latest [release page](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix/releases/latest).
    2. Download :material-zip-box:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.zip`.
    3. Extract the archive into the game folder.
        - Consider re-running the Setup Utility if you used it on the [Optimization](../../optimization.md) or [Additional Setup](../../additional-setup.md) pages.

=== "1.0.8.0"
    1. Go to the latest [release page](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix/releases/latest).
    2. Download :material-zip-box:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.zip`.
    3. Extract the archive into the game folder.
    4. Move the files out of the :material-folder: ==plugins== folder into the game folder (don't ask me why, this tends to improve stability).
        - Rename :fontawesome-solid-gears:`dinput8.dll` to `xlive.dll` **if not using GFWL**. Replace if needed.
        - {--Consider re-running the Setup Utility if you used it on the [Optimization](../../optimization.md) or [Additional Setup](../../additional-setup.md) pages.--}

        Apply this [patch](https://github.com/gillian-guide/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix-GFWL/releases/latest) on top.

        If **only playing multiplayer**, consider the multiplayer-only [patch](https://github.com/SandeMC/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix-GFWLMin/releases/latest) for increased stability instead.

Most of options are available in the in-game settings.

You can edit :material-file-cog:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.ini` or :material-file-cog:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.cfg` if you need to edit the settings outside of the game for some reason. See [the list of non-ingame options](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix?tab=readme-ov-file#details) if you need to tweak them.
