# Recommended Enhancements

Following mods are not essential to playing the game, but they're highly recommended to have a good experience or a good enough base for your own modpack.

!!! warning ""
    [Ultimate ASI Loader](../resources/mod-dependencies.md/#ultimate-asi-loader) and [FusionFix](../essential-modding/fusionfix.md) are required for most mods. **This page will assume you have both installed and will not remind you of it.**

    Keep in mind there is a recommended load order at the bottom.

!!! warning "For Linux users"
    When installing mods, be careful and take note when filenames have different casing (e.g. `weaponinfo.xml` and `weaponInfo.xml`). Make sure to merge them accordingly.

## Recommended load order and `.img` limits

Please use the following load order (put the number before the folder names) after installing the mods above:

1. Minor Mods (any other mod you don't see below is considered minor - their order doesn't matter that much but they should be loaded on top)
2. Restored Trees Position
3. Restored Pedestrians
4. Higher Resolution Miscellaneous Pack
5. Vehicle Mods (Vehicle Pack, Resized Blista etc.)
6. Characters Fixes
7. Console Visuals
8. Project Glass
9. More Visible Interiors
10. FusionFix (leave it at the default folder name for ease of updating)
11. Various Fixes (leave it at the default folder name to make it easier for managing with FusionFix)

You may want to manually merge some `.img` mods together using [OpenIV](../resources/openiv.md/#creating-archives) to avoid going over the limit.

You can see how far you are on the limits if you set `ExtraInfo` to `1` in FusionFix's :material-file-cog:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.ini` - it'll give the number on bottom of the screen in settings - **but only on 1.2.0.58**. If you are using an older version, you can only tell if you went over the limit by going into TBoGT and seeing whether traffic spawns (if it doesn't - you're over the limit and it's a sign to merge some mods).
