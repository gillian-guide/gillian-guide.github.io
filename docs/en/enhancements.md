## Recommended load order and `.img` limits

Please use the following load order (put the number before the folder names) after installing the mods above:

1. Minor Mods (any other mod you don't see below is considered minor - thier order doesn't matter that much but they should be loaded on top)
2. Restored Trees Position
3. Restored Pedestrians
4. Higher Resolution Miscellaneous Pack
5. Vehicle Mods (Vehicle Pack, Resized Blista etc.)
6. Characters Fixes
7. Console Visuals
8. Project Glass
9. More Visible Interiors
10. Various Fixes
11. FusionFix (leave it at the default folder name for ease of updating)

You may want to manually merge some `.img` mods together using [OpenIV](../resources/openiv.md/#creating-archives) to avoid going over the limit.

You can see how far you are on the limits if you set `ExtraInfo` to `1` in FusionFix's :material-file-cog:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.ini` - it'll give the number on bottom of the screen in settings - **but only on 1.2.0.58**. If you are using an older version, you can only tell if you went over the limit by going into TBoGT and seeing whether traffic spawns (if it doesn't - you're over the limit and it's a sign to merge some mods).
