## Why downgrade the radio?

In April 2018, over 50 radio station tracks were removed from the game due to expired licenses and replaced with unauthentic tracks instead.

## Why downgrade the game?

Over the years, the game received multiple game versions with many changes in-between. You may want to downgrade if one of the following applies to you:

- You want to play official multiplayer.
- You want to get rid of the DRM.
- You have some specific mods in mind that don't support Complete Edition (i.e. Liberty Tweaks).
- You want to mess around with graphical mods (i.e. ICEnhancer). I don't recommend nor support them, by the way.

However, be aware that **you will miss out on some of the latest fixes**, as FusionFix does not *fully* support downgraded versions.

## Navigation

To make things easier later, you should decide what do you want to downgrade right now between radio, the game version, or both.
