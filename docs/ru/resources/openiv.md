# [OpenIV](https://openiv.com/)

OpenIV is a powerful tool for modifying, creating and extracting internal files. It can be used to create `.img` and `.rpf` files, which can be useful for [modloading](../../extras/modloading.md) or mod creation. You may also, very rarely, come across mods packaged in `.oiv` - this tool allows you to install them as well.
