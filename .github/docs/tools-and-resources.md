## Choose a reliable text editor

The tool you use to edit and create content is crucial. Choose one that suits your needs.

If you're unsure, consider using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Implement a linter

To minimize errors, consider using a linter specifically for `markdown` files, such as [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint).

> Note: The linter can utilize the `.markdownlint.json` file to observe any disabled or modified rules.
